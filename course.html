Below I provide some information about the course.
<br>
<br>
	
The course is about expressiveness and algorithmic properties of two models:
<br>
- Weighted automata. A model extending finite automata, which instead of recognising words assigns some number to words. For example an automaton A can count the number of a's and then A(abbaa) = 3.
<br>
- Linear recurrence sequences. For example the Fibonacci sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,... where each element is the sum of its two previous elements.
<br>
<br>
I assume basic knowledge with finite automata theory (regular languages etc), basic complexity theory (what does it mean to be decidable in PSPACE or in NP), and basic properties of linear recurrence sequences (like the characterisitic polynomial).
